# TeachR

This project was made during the SigmaHacks3 Hackathon between 25-26 June 2021.

## Inspiration
Our mum, who is a teacher herself, inspired us to create this project. We were driven by the idea to provide collated educational resources that would help improve the delivery of educational materials in classrooms and in remote learning scenarios. Due to the pandemic, many parents also had to take the role of teachers. This project, will hopefully, help both teachers and parents provide interesting and engaging learning activities which could be incorporated in children's daily learning plans. 

## What it does
This is a web application that takes the grade and subject taught by the teacher, teaching method and technical resources available for the teacher and provides them with pre-made slides, website resources and relevant games that can be incorporated in their lesson plan.

## How we built it
We used basic HTML and CSS to create the front end of the website. We incorporated Python Flask to provide functionality to our website. We used SQLite as our storage database and SQLAlchemy, a Python library that provides an object relational mapping. 

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into numerous challenges as we were just learning to use Python Flask and SQLAlchemy. We ran short of time and was unable to actually connect to our database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to collate resources and present it (even if it was through hardcoding the functionality). We are also super proud of the idea as we think this would really help improve quality of education and reduce the time spent in creating interesting resources.

## What we learned
We learnt more about Python Flask using the given resources and asking questions to available MLH Mentors!

## What's next for TeachR
We would like to implement the database and also automate the collation of resources through potential machine learning technology. 

## **How to run**
